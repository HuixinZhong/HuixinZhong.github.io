In this unit, AI Ph.D. students are required to collaborate in interdisciplinary teams to propose solutions to current AI challenges that integrate computer science, social science, and electronic engineering. As the instructor, I guide each team in brainstorming, establishing clear roles and responsibilities, developing timelines, and ensuring that the social science aspect of the project is fully considered.
