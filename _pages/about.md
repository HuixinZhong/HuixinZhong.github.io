I completed my Ph.D. at the [Center for Doctoral Training in Accountable, Responsible and Transparent AI](https://cdt-art-ai.ac.uk) at the University of Bath, specializing in interdisciplinary research spanning AI, psychology, behavioral economics, and law.

My Ph.D. thesis, titled "Understanding Social Influence on Decision-Making in Human-AI Teams," explored the dynamics of social conformity within human-AI interactions. In addition to this, my broader research focuses on interdisciplinary AI governance. I am currently expanding into an emerging field known as machine psychology.
